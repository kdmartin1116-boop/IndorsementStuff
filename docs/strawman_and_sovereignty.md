## Why This Document Exists

This document explains "strawman" and "sovereignty" theories to:

## What the "Strawman" Theory Claims (FALSE)

**IMPORTANT: These claims are FALSE and not recognized by any court.**

The "Strawman" theory falsely claims:
- A separate legal entity is created when you're born
- Your name in capital letters represents this "strawman" 
- You can "redeem" or control this entity and its supposed assets
- The government uses this to control and tax you

**REALITY: This is completely false. There is no "strawman" entity, no secret accounts, and no legal basis for these claims.**

## What "Asserting Sovereignty" Claims (DANGEROUS)

**IMPORTANT: These methods are ILLEGAL and result in criminal charges.**

Sovereignty proponents falsely claim you can:
- Refuse to follow laws by claiming to be "sovereign"
- Avoid taxes and legal obligations  
- Challenge court jurisdiction with special phrases
- File UCC documents to claim ownership of a fictional "strawman"

**REALITY: Courts reject 100% of these arguments and impose criminal penalties.**
