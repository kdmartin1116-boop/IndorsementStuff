## Strengthened Warning Language

### 1. Pseudolegal Warning Enhancement
**Current:** "These theories don't work"
**Enhanced:** "These theories have been universally rejected by courts and have resulted in criminal prosecutions, significant financial penalties, and imprisonment for those who attempt to use them."

### 2. Criminal Consequence Clarity
**Add specific warnings:**
- "Document fraud is a federal crime punishable by up to 20 years imprisonment"
- "Mail fraud carries penalties of up to 20 years in federal prison"  
- "Tax evasion can result in up to 5 years imprisonment plus substantial fines"
- "Contempt of court can result in immediate incarceration"

## Professional Referral Improvements

### 1. Attorney Referral Language
**Current:** "Contact state bar associations"
**Enhanced:** "Contact your state bar association's lawyer referral service, which can connect you with attorneys who are licensed in your jurisdiction, have experience in your type of legal matter, and meet the bar's screening requirements."

### 2. Legal Aid Referral Language  
**Current:** "Legal aid societies provide free help"
**Enhanced:** "Legal aid organizations provide free legal services to eligible individuals based on income guidelines and case type priorities. Eligibility requirements and available services vary by location and organization."

## Case Law Citation Improvements

### 1. Add Proper Legal Citations

**U.S. v. Schneider:** Add full citation and jurisdiction
**Add disclaimer:** "Case law citations are provided for educational purposes. Legal precedents can be complex and may not apply to all jurisdictions or circumstances."

### 2. Court Decision Explanations
**Add context:**
- Explain that Canadian decisions like Meads v. Meads are persuasive but not binding in U.S. courts
- Note that federal court decisions vary by circuit
- Clarify that Supreme Court lack of action doesn't equal endorsement

## Educational Content Enhancements

### 1. Consumer Law Procedure Clarifications
**Add specific notes:**
- FDCPA debt validation: "The 30-day period begins from when you receive the debt collector's initial communication, but specific requirements may vary"
- FCRA disputes: "Credit bureaus generally have 30 days to investigate, but this may be extended under certain circumstances"
- State law variations: "Many states have additional consumer protection laws that may provide greater rights than federal law"

### 2. Legal Process Explanations
**Add complexity warnings:**
- "Legal procedures can be complex and technical requirements must be met exactly"
- "Missing deadlines or failing to follow proper procedures can result in loss of rights"
- "What constitutes proper legal procedure varies by jurisdiction and type of case"

## Professional Responsibility Safeguards

### 1. Unauthorized Practice Prevention
**Add throughout:**
- "This information is not legal advice for your specific situation"
- "Laws and procedures vary by jurisdiction"
- "Always consult with an attorney licensed in your jurisdiction"
- "We do not provide legal advice or representation"

### 2. Information vs. Advice Distinction
**Clarify language:**
